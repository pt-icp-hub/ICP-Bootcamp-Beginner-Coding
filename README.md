# Beginner Challenge for ICP Bootcamp

Welcome to this tutorial that is for people to get started into ICP, a decentralized cloud built on blockchain technology. Architected for being general purpose, the only limit you have is your imagination. 🙂🚀

On this challenge, the main goals are:

- to introduce to IC, showcasing great examples of what is already possible
- to help you getting started in a quick but still effective way
- to hopefully convince you the IC stack and ecosystem is a great place to have a Dev career or co-found a startup.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge will be in Motoko. We have prepared a Codespace for you, so you don't waste time on local setup and can go directly to the fun part, coding! ⌨️

In this challenge you will:
- Develop a canister (backend) that logs in with Internet Identity.
- Work on the backend, understanding data structures, packages, stable/dynamic memory, etc.
- You will allow to setup a user profile and safely store user records.
